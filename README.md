# Genetic-Algo-to-compute-maxima-minima-of-a-function
Simple implimentation of a genetic algorithm to work out the maxima or minima or a function

Current function x[0]^2 + x[1]^2.
Algo is used to calculate x1, x2 for the minima of the above function.

Vars:

n_bits - resolution of the values used.
n_iter - generations to run.
n_pop - population size.
r_cross - rate at which a random part of the bistring is swapped.
r_mut - rate at which a random bit in the bistring is flipped.


See Algo-Overview for description of the algorithm
